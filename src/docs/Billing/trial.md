## Game Cloud Timed Deletion Policy
If a paid server has not been running for more than a month, it will be automatically deleted, freeing up computing resources for a new server owners. Deleting a server will remove all map backups and player data from that server. If the server map archive is a valuable memory, please back it up and download it within one month of the server being closed. Once a server has been deleted, it cannot be restored.
