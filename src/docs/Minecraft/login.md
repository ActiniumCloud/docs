# Failed to Login: Invalid Session

## A non-premium (cracked) player is connecting to a online server

There are two solutions:

1) Disable the license check on the server:

Find the server.properties file in the server folder, then the online-mode=true line, and change it to online-mode=false. Restart your server and now you can connect to it.

2) Tell the players to buy Minecraft and connect to the server with a non-cracked account.
